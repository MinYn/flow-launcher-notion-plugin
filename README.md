*Navigating the integrations dashboard to create a new internal integration.*

The integration will be internal by default. If you are building a public integration, you will need to make it public under the tab.`Distribution`

## 2. [Get your API secret](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#get-your-api-secret)

*Secrets tab in integrations dashboard.*

```
üëç Keep your API secret a secret!

Any value used to authenticate API requests should always be kept secret. Use environment variables and avoid committing sensitive data to your version control history.

If you do accidentally expose it, remember to ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù your secret.
```

## 4. [Give your integration page permissions](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#give-your-integration-page-permissions)

2. Click on the ... More menu in the top-right corner of the page. `...`

*Give your integration permission to add a database to a page.*

Your integration can now make API requests related to this Notion page and any of its children.

If you are building a public integration, use the authorization instructions included in the Authorization guide instead.

```
üöß If your API requests are failing, confirm you have given the integration permission to the page you are trying to update. This is a common cause of API request errors.
```
